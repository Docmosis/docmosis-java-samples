<!--
*
* This file is an example configuration for a pool of Docmosis converters.
*
* The pool is divided into "groups" in any desired arrangement and an "instance" may be
* requested from a particular group.
* 
* Instances may be "embedded" or "remote".
*
* Embedded converters are launched automatically and managed, but they also
* can't be offloaded to another host.
* A group of embedded converters can be defined by setting:
*   officeConverterClass="embedded"
* Then you can specify the number of embedded converters like this:
*   <instance count="X"/>
*
* Remote converters are useful because they can move the processing load and the
* OpenOffice/LibreOffice dependancy to other hosts and can be easily shutdown and
* started to correct anomalies or changing the pool structure.
* A group of remote converters can be defined by setting:
*   officeConverterClass="remote"
* Each instance of a remote converter is defined using this line:
*   <instance hostname="XXXX" port="XXXX"/>
*
*
* Groups can be conditionally enabled using the attribute "enableOnlyIfSysPropSet"
* (see the example down the bottom).
*
-->


<!--
*
* Define a Converter pool with the default group set to "groupOne".
*
* Docmosis will use converters from the default group unless you set a group using:
*   com.docmosis.document.converter.ConversionInstruction.setConverterGroupName
*
-->

<converter-pool defaultGroup="groupOne">


<!--
*
* Define a group named "groupOne" which is a group of remote converters.
*
-->
  <group name="groupOne" description="Converter group using only remote converters"
         officeConverterClass="remote">

    <instance hostname="localhost" port="2100"/>

<!--
*
* Add more <instance> lines to run more remote coverters.
*
*   <instance hostname="localhost" port="2101"/>
*   <instance hostname="localhost" port="2102"/>
*
-->

</group>


<!--
*
*  Define a group named "groupTwo" which is a group of embedded converters.
*
-->

  <group name="groupTwo" description="Converter group using only embedded converters"
         officeConverterClass="embedded">

    <instance count="1"/>

  </group>


<!--
*
* Example of a group that is activated depending on the value of a System property.
*
* The system property must be set before the call to SystemManager.initialise().
*
* In this example, this group will only initialise if the Java System Property
* "application.env" is set to "uat".  This can be set for any group using the
* attribute "enableOnlyIfSysPropSet" as shown.
*

  <group name="groupUAT" description="Remote converter used only for UAT"
         officeConverterClass="remote"
         enableOnlyIfSysPropSet="application.env=uat">

     <instance hostname="localhost" port="2100"/>

  </group>
